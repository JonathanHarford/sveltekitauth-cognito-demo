# sveltekitauth-cognito-demo

This is Zain Sajjad's [SvelteKit Auth with AWS Cognito](https://blog.logrocket.com/sveltekit-auth-aws-cognito) tutorial with the following changes that seemed necessary to get it to work:

1. Per [Seamus Walsh's recommendation](https://blog.logrocket.com/sveltekit-auth-aws-cognito/#comment-37076), the versions of SveltekitAuth
 and AuthCore have been pinned to 0.3.0: `pnpm install @auth/sveltekit@0.3.0 @auth/core@0.3.0`

2. Changed `$lib/domains/auth/` references to `$lib/domain/auth/`. Seems like a typo?

3. [Generated](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) and added AUTH_SECRET to .env file (of course, this was not committed)

Run with `pnpm dev`.
