# sveltekitauth-cognito-demo

This is Zain Sajjad's https://blog.logrocket.com/sveltekit-auth-aws-cognito[SvelteKit Auth with AWS Cognito] tutorial with the following changes that seemed necessary to get it to work:

1. Following on from https://blog.logrocket.com/sveltekit-auth-aws-cognito/#comment-37076[Seamus Walsh's recommendation], the versions of SveltekitAuth
 and AuthCore have been installed without @next: `pnpm install @auth/sveltekit @auth/core`

2. Changed `$lib/domains/auth/` references to `$lib/domain/auth/`. Seems like a typo?

3. https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32[Generated] and added AUTH_SECRET to .env file (of course, this was not committed)

Run with `pnpm dev`.
